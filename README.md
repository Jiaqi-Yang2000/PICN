Here we provide the codes for physics-informed convolutional neural network in predicting temperatures of the surface of arch dams. Details can be found in "A physics informed convolution neural network for spatiotemporal temperature analysis of concrete dams". We will provide additional links after the article is officially accepted, thank you!
